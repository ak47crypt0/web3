          <ul>
            <li>• the types of information we may collect;</li>
            <li>• how we use the information we collect;</li>

          <h1>The Types of Information We Collect</h1>

          We may collect and receive information about you from various sources,
          including: (a) directly from you when you provide it to us, (b)
          indirectly from you when you use the Portal Services, and (c) from
          third-party websites, services, and partners.<br />
          “Personal information” is any information that can be used to identify
          you or that we can link to you as an individual. We collect your
          personal information when you provide it to us.<br /><br />

          <h1>Information you provide to us directly</h1>
          You can use some of our Portal Services without providing us with any
          personal information. However, when you register for an Account, you
          provide us with personal information, including items such as your
          name and email address. Using your Account and accessing other
          portions of our Portal Services may require that you enter a password
          or other credentials. Your password or credentials are stored locally
          on your device or computer, and they are never transmitted to us.<br /><br />

          If you contact us directly, we may also receive personal information
          and other information about you, such as your name, title, email
          address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments
          you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.
          We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.<br /><br />
          <h1>Information we may collect indirectly</h1>
          We use browser cookies and similar tracking technologies
          (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and store certain information
          when you use, access, or interact with our Portal Services.<br /><br />
          Cookies are small files of information, usually stored on your
          application, computer or device, that allows our web servers or our
          third-party services to recognize you. We store information that we
          collect through Cookies to record your preferences, settings and
          status for the Portal Services and to analyze how you use the Portal
          Services. In some countries, including countries in the European
          Economic Area (“EEA”), the information referenced above in this
          paragraph may be considered personal information under applicable data
          protection laws. (More details below under the section entitled “Your
          Choices and Rights.”)<br />
          With Cookies, we may, for example, collect information about the type
          of device you use to access the Portal Services, the operating system
          and version, your IP address, your general geographic location as
          indicated by your IP address, your browser type, and data on your
          interaction with the Portal Services (such as search terms you enter
          or your frequency of usage, including your usage across different
          websites and applications). We may also collect data regarding the
          functionality of our Portal Services, including system-level metrics,
          to help us operate, maintain and improve the performance and
          utilization of the Portal Services, to develop new features, protect
          the security and safety of our Portal Services and our customers, and
          to provide customer support. We also use this data to develop
          aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to
          operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the
          performance of our business.<br /><br />

          <h1>Information we may collect from third party sources</h1>
          We may receive information about you from third parties that help us
          update, expand, and analyze our records, and to prevent or detect
          fraud. If you choose to link our Portal Services to a third-party
          account, we will receive information about that account, such as your
          authentication token from the third-party account, to authorize
          linking. Please note that the information we may receive is governed
          by the privacy settings, policies, and/or procedures of the third
          party.<br />
          We may also collect information from social media platforms that share
          information about how you interact with our social media content.
          Further, we may also receive publicly-available information about you
          from our third-party partners and combine it with data that we have
          about you.<br /><br />

          <h1>How We Use the Information We Collect</h1>

          The above uses may involve information that has been aggregated so
          that the data is no longer capable of identifying an individual. This

          <h1>Legal Basis for Using Personal Information</h1>
          Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will
          depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context
          in which we collect it.<br />
          However, we normally collect and use your personal information only
          when doing so (a) is needed in order to perform our contractual or
          legal obligations to you; (b) is in our legitimate interests and not
          overridden by your rights; or (c) is done with your consent. We have a
          legitimate interest in operating our Portal Services and communicating
          with you as necessary to provide these Portal Services, for example
          when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking
          marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal
          activities.<br />
          If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
          requirement or to perform our contractual obligations with you, we
          will make this clear at the relevant time and will advise you whether
          the provision of your personal information is mandatory, which
          includes the possible consequences of not providing your personal
          information.<br />
          You may withdraw any consent you have granted for use of your personal
          information by contacting us through the information we provide under
          the section entitled “Contact Us” below. When required by applicable
          law, we will rely on your consent for direct marketing and to collect
          information from your device or computer.<br />
          <br />
          <h1>How We Protect and Store the Information we collect</h1>
          We deploy administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed
          to comply with applicable legal requirements and safeguard the
          information that we collect. However, no information system can be
          100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
          information. Moreover, information you transmit to us over networks
          that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks,
          may be compromised. The Portal Services are controlled and operated by
          5thWeb.io. We may store the information we collect in the EEA or in
          other countries where we or our service providers have facilities. We
          may transfer information to countries outside of your country of
          residence which may have data protection laws and regulations that
          differ from those in your country. We retain personal information we
          collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to
          do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested
          or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
          We retain the information we collect for no longer than is reasonably
          necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect the information
          and to comply with our legal obligations.
          <br />
          <br />

          materials) or links to content or services provided by third parties
          (such as on outside websites). This Privacy Policy does not address
          the privacy, security, or other practices of the third parties that
          provide such content or services. We are not responsible for the
          privacy policies and/or practices of these third parties, and we
          encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies and their
          terms of service.<br />

          different websites and online platforms.<br /><br />
