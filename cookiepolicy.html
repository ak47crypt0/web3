        what cookies are and how they're being used by 5thWeb.io website
        (“Website” or “Service”). Please read this Policy and all its terms
        and conditions carefully. By accessing and using the Website and

        You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies.
        However, please note that if you choose to refuse cookies you may not
        be able to use the full functionality of our Websites and Services.
        Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings
